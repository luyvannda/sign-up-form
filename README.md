## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Sass
- Bootstrap 5
- React Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to combine Bootstrap 5, React Bootstrap with Sass to create a responsive web page for this project. 


### Continued development

I found myself having to replace vanilla Bootstrap 5 with React Bootstrap for form validation otherwise there were issues where form feedbacks were always shown on screen all the time. With React Bootstrap, I managed to set up form feedbacks so that they display differently for valid and invalid input. Will need to work more with React Bootstrap form validation in future projects for improvement.
