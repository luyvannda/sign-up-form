## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Sass
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to combine React Bootstrap with Sass to create a responsive web page for this project. 


### Continued development

I am still not able to figure out how to toggle the form control feedback after form is submitted. For now, need to delve deeper into both React and React Bootstrap in form validation.
